# ErrorCollisionMatrix
ErrorCollisionMatrix is a local Singleplayer game that revolves around the concept of walls that can be penetrated and be seen through, and levels filled with enemies
and puzzles.

## Overview
The player procceds throught a facility, going through levels and solving puzzles along the way. The player has to simultaneously stay alive from the onslaught of enemies, which becomes increasingly
harder as the level increases.

The player has a special ability to see through walls, helping them spot enemies and hidden items. This skill lets the player plan and act carefully to beat each level. The player can also shoot through walls, making it easier to take out enemies from hidden spots.

Throughout the game, the player will find tools in the environment that provide help and guidance, making it easier to figure out and complete each level.
